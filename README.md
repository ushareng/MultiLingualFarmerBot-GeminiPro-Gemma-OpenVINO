Multilingual Audio based Farmer’s helper bot with Intel’s OpenVINO and Gemma

Open-sourcing large language models (LLMs) boosts global access to AI technology. Although unlikely, it’s possible that the next big AI innovation could come from someone without access to widespread computing resources. However, in AI application development, there’s more flexibility in infrastructure choice. The combination of accessible CPUs, scalability, and open-source licensing of LLMs greatly supports AI progress.

This project explores the intriguing process of fine-tuning Gemma and leveraging OpenVINO for quantization to achieve multilingual capabilities.
